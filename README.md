Extension of Matlab visualisation system by external raytracer - [POV-Ray](http://www.povray.org/).

The project is experimental and in active development now.\
To start working with toolbox:

1. Install it in Matlab.
2. Install [POV-Ray](http://www.povray.org/) in your system.
3. Edit ex_setup.m file according to location of POV ray and desired image quality.
4. Play with examples - try to uncomment code and explore different behaviour.
5. Run applications - 'app_surface' for surface and 'app_volume' for volume visualizations.
6. Send feedback about issues and suggestion for future development.
