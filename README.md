Extends Matlab's visualisation system by external raytracer - [POV-Ray](http://www.povray.org/).\
Useful for presentations, learning 3D graphics in schools and universities.
Please find live examples [here](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/123520-pov-lab-matlab-interface-to-pov-ray) under *Examples* tab.

To start working with toolbox:

1. Install it in Matlab.
2. Install [POV-Ray](http://www.povray.org/) in your system.
3. Edit ex_setup.m file according to location of POV-Ray and desired image quality.
4. Play with examples - try to change code, make experiments and explore different behaviour.
5. Run applications - 'app_surface' for surface and 'app_volume' for volume visualizations.

Please feel free to send feedback about issues and suggestions for future development.
